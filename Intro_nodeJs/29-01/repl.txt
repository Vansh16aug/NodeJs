##REPL -> Read eval print loop

It takes single expression as user input and returns the result back to the console after execution. The REPL session provides a convenient way to quickly test simple JavaScript code.


##The _ special variable

If after some code you type _, that is going to print the result of the last operation.

## Dot commands

The REPL has some special commands, all starting with a dot .. They are

    .help: shows the dot commands help

    .editor: enables editor mode, to write multiline JavaScript code with ease. Once you are in this mode, enter ctrl-D to run the code you wrote.

    .break: when inputting a multi-line expression, entering the .break command will abort further input. Same as pressing ctrl-C.

    .clear: resets the REPL context to an empty object and clears any multi-line expression currently being input.

    .load: loads a JavaScript file, relative to the current working directory

    .save: saves all you entered in the REPL session to a file (specify the filename)

    .exit: exits the repl (same as pressing ctrl-C two times)
